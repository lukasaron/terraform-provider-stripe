# stripe_coupon

With this resource, you can create a coupon - [Stripe API coupon documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/coupons).

A coupon contains information about a percent-off or amount-off discount you might want to apply to a customer.

A coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoiceâ€™s subtotal. 

For example, an invoice with a subtotal of $100 will have a final total of $0 if a coupon with an amount_off of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of $300 will have a final total of $100 if a coupon with an amount_off of 20000 is applied to it.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// coupon for the amount off discount
resource "stripe_coupon" "coupon" {
  name            = "$10 amount off"
  amount_off      = 1000
  currency        = "aud"
  duration        = "once"
  max_redemptions = 10
}

// coupon for the percentage off discount
resource "stripe_coupon" "coupon" {
  name        = "33.3% discount"
  percent_off = 33.3
  duration    = "forever"
}

// coupon with limitation to a date and the product only
resource "stripe_coupon" "coupon" {
  name       = "applies to prod with ID 123 till a date"
  amount_off = 2000
  duration   = "once"
  redeem_by  = "2025-07-23T03:27:06+00:00"
  // the stripe_product.product has to be created separately
  applies_to = [stripe_product.product.id] 
}
```
