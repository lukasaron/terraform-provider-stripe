# stripe_meter

With this resource, you can create a billing meter - [Stripe API billing meter documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter).

A billing meter is a resource that allows you to track usage of a particular event. For example, you might create a billing meter to track the number of API calls made by a particular user. You can then attach the billing meter to a price and attach the price to a subscription to charge the user for the number of API calls they make.

~> Removal of the Billing Meter isn't supported through the Stripe SDK. The best practice, which this provider follows,
is to deactivate the Billing Meter by marking it as inactive on destroy, which indicates that resource is no longer
available.


## Example Usage

```hcl
// meter
resource "stripe_meter" "sample_meter" {
  display_name = "A Sample meter"
  event_name   = "sample_meter"

  customer_mapping {
    event_payload_key = "stripe_customer_id"
    type              = "by_id"
  }

  default_aggregation {
    formula = "sum"
  }

  value_settings {
    event_payload_key = "value"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

Arguments accepted by this resource include:

* `default_aggregation` - (Required) List(Resource). The default settings to aggregate a meter’s events with.
* `display_name` - (Required) String. The display name of the meter.
* `event_name` - (Required) String. The name of the meter event to record usage for. Corresponds with the `event_name` field on meter events.
* `customer_mapping` - (Optional) Lst(Resource). Fields that specify how to map a meter event to a customer.
* `event_time_window` - (Optional) String. The time window to pre-aggregate meter events for, if any. Possible values are:
  * `day` - Events are pre-aggregated in daily buckets
  * `hour` - Events are pre-aggregated in hourly buckets
* `value_settings` - (Optional) List(Resource). Fields that specify how to calculate a meter event’s value.

### Default Aggregation

`default_aggregation` Supports the following arguments:

* `formula` - (Required) String. Specifies how events are aggregated. Allowed values are `count` to count the number of events and `sum` to sum each event’s value.

### Customer Mapping

`customer_mapping` Supports the following arguments:

* `event_payload_key` - (Required) String. The key in the event payload to use for customer mapping.
* `type` - (Required) String. The method for mapping a meter event to a customer. Must be `by_id`.

### Value Settings

`value_settings` Supports the following arguments:

`event_payload_key` - (Required) String. The key in the usage event payload to use as the value for this meter. For example, if the event payload contains usage on a bytes_used field, then set the event_payload_key to “bytes_used”.

## Attribute Reference

Attributes exported by this resource include:

* `id` - String. The unique identifier for the object.
* `display_name` - String. The display name of the meter.
* `event_name` - String. The name of the meter event to record usage for. Corresponds with the `event_name` field on meter events.
* `event_time_window` - String. The time window to pre-aggregate meter events for, if any.
* `default_aggregation` - List(Resource). The default settings to aggregate a meter’s events with. Fields that specify how to aggregate a meter event such as `formula`.
* `customer_mapping` - List(Resource). Fields that specify how to map a meter event to a customer such as `event_payload_key` and `type`.
* `value_settings` - List(Resource). Fields that specify how to calculate a meter event’s value such as `event_payload_key`.

## Note on updating meters

Once created, you can update the `display_name`.

Other attribute edits will trigger a destroy action (archival) and creation of a new meter entry.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
$ terraform import stripe_meter.meter <meter_id>
```
