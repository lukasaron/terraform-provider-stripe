# stripe_card

With this resource, you can create a card - [Stripe API card documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/cards).

You can store multiple cards on a customer in order to charge the customer later. You can also store multiple debit
cards on a recipient in order to transfer to those cards later.

~> Passing your cardholder’s full credit card number to Stripe’s API isn't a recommended approach. In rare cases, you
may have to continue handling full credit card information directly. If this applies to you, you can enable unsafe 
processing in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/integration).

~> Using the stripe_card resource may potentially leak credit card information into your Terraform State. 
Please see [these recommendations](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/sensitive-data.html#recommendations) 
on how to treat sensitive data in Terraform State.

## Example Usage

```hcl


// card for the customer
resource "stripe_card" "card" {
  // stripe_customer.customer has to be created separately
  customer  = stripe_customer.customer.id
  number    = "4242424242424242"
  name      = "Lukas Aron"
  cvc       = 123
  exp_month = 8
  exp_year  = 2030
}

// card for the customer with address
resource "stripe_card" "card" {
  // stripe_customer.customer has to be created separately
  customer  = stripe_customer.customer.id
  number    = "4242424242424242"
  name      = "Lukas Aron"
  cvc       = 123
  exp_month = 8
  exp_year  = 2030
