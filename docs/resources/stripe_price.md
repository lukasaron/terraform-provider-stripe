# stripe_price

With this resource, you can create a price - [Stripe API price documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/prices).

Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of
products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms.

Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be
represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and â‚¬9 once.

~> Removal of the price isn't supported through the Stripe SDK. The best practice, which this provider follows,
is to archive the price by marking it as inactive on destroy, which indicates that the price is no longer
available for purchase.

## Example Usage

```hcl
// basic price for the product
resource "stripe_price" "price" {
  // product needs to be defined
  product     = stripe_product.product.id
  currency    = "aud"
  unit_amount = 100
}

// basic free price for the product
resource "stripe_price" "price" {
  // product needs to be defined
  product     = stripe_product.product.id
  currency    = "aud"
  unit_amount = -1
}

// recurring price for the product
resource "stripe_price" "price" {
  // product needs to be defined
  product        = stripe_product.product.id
  currency       = "aud"
  billing_scheme = "per_unit"
  unit_amount    = "100"

  recurring {
    interval       = "week"
    interval_count = 1
  }
}

// tiered price for the product
resource "stripe_price" "price" {
  // product needs to be defined
  product        = stripe_product.product.id
  currency       = "aud"
  billing_scheme = "tiered"
  tiers_mode     = "graduated"

  # free up to ten
  tiers {
    up_to       = 10
    unit_amount = 0 // can be omitted
  }

  tiers {
    up_to       = 100
    unit_amount = 300
  }

  tiers {
    up_to               = -1
    unit_amount_decimal = 100.5
  }

  recurring {
    interval        = "week"
    aggregate_usage = "sum"
    interval_count  = 2
    usage_type      = "metered"
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

Arguments accepted by this resource include:

* `currency` - (Required) String. Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase - [supported currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
* `product` - (Required) String. The ID of the product that this price will belong to.
* `unit_amount` - (Required unless `billing_scheme = tiered`) Int. A positive integer in cents (or `-1` for a free
  price) representing how much to charge.
* `unit_amount_decimal` - (Optional) Float. Same as `unit_amount`, but accepts a decimal value in cents with at most 12
  decimal places. Only one of `unit_amount` and `unit_amount_decimal` can be set.
* `active` - (Optional) Bool. Whether the price can be used for new purchases. Defaults to `true`.
* `nickname` - (Optional) String. A brief description of the price, hidden from customers.
* `recurring` - (Optional) List(Resource). The recurring components of a price such as `interval` and `usage_type`. For
  details of individual arguments see [Recurring](#recurring).
* `tiers` - (Optional) List(Resource). Each element represents a pricing tier. This parameter requires `billing_scheme`
  to be set to `tiered`. See also the documentation for `billing_scheme`. For details of individual arguments
  see [Tiers](#tiers).
* `tiers_mode` - (Required if `billing_scheme = tiered`) String. Defines if the tiering price should be `graduated`
  or `volume` based. In `volume`-based tiering, the maximum quantity within a period determines the per-unit price,
  in `graduated` tiering pricing can successively change as the quantity grows.
* `billing_scheme` - (Optional) String. Describes how to compute the price per period. Either `per_unit` or `tiered`
  . `per_unit` indicates that the fixed amount (specified in `unit_amount` or `unit_amount_decimal`) will be charged per
  unit in quantity (for prices with `usage_type=licensed`), or per unit of total usage (for prices
  with `usage_type=metered`). `tiered` indicates that the unit pricing will be computed using a tiering strategy as
  defined using the `tiers` and `tiers_mode` attributes.
* `currency_options` - (Optional) List(Resource). Prices defined in each available currency option. For details
  of individual arguments see [Currency Options](#currency-options).
* `lookup_key` - (Optional) String. A lookup key used to retrieve prices dynamically from a static string.
* `transfer_lookup_key` - (Optional) Bool. If set to `true`, will atomically remove the lookup key from the existing
  price, and assign it to this price.
* `tax_behaviour` - (Optional) String. Specifies whether the price is considered inclusive of taxes or exclusive of
  taxes. One of `inclusive`, `exclusive`, or `unspecified`. Once specified as either `inclusive` or `exclusive`, it
  cannot be changed, default is `unspecified`.
* `transform_quantity` - (Optional) List(Resource). Apply a transformation to the reported usage or set quantity before
  computing the billed price. Cannot be combined with `tiers`. For details of individual arguments
  see [Transform Quantity](#transform-quantity).
* `metadata` - (Optional) Map(String). Set of key-value pairs that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for
  storing additional information about the object in a structured format.

### Recurring

`recurring` Supports the following arguments:

* `interval` - (Required) String. Specifies billing frequency. Either `day`, `week`, `month` or `year`.
* `aggregate_usage` - (Optional) String. Specifies a usage of aggregation strategy for prices of `usage_type=metered`.
  Allowed values are `sum` for summing up all usage during a period, `last_during_period` for using the last usage
  record reported within a period, `last_ever` for using the last usage record ever (across period bounds) or `max`
  which uses the usage record with the maximum reported usage during a period.
* `interval_count` - (Optional) Int. This parameter is (Required) when interval value is set. The number of intervals between subscription billings. For
  example, `interval=month` and `interval_count=3` bills every 3 months. Maximum of one year interval allowed (1 year,
  12 months, or 52 weeks).
* `usage_type` - (Optional) String. Configures how the quantity per period should be determined. Can be either `metered`
  or `licensed`. `licensed` automatically bills the quantity set when adding it to a subscription. `metered` aggregates
  the total usage based on usage records. Defaults to `licensed`.

### Tiers

`tiers` Can be used multiple times within the Price resource and supports the following arguments:

* `up_to` - (Required) Int. Specifies the upper bound of this tier. The lower bound of a tier is the upper bound of the
  previous tier adding one. Use `-1` to define a fallback tier.
* `flat_amount` - (Optional) Int. The flat billing amount for an entire tier, regardless of the number of units in the
  tier.
* `flat_amount_decimal` - (Optional) Float. Same as `flat_amount`, but accepts a decimal value representing an integer
  in the minor units of the currency. Only one of `flat_amount` and `flat_amount_decimal` can be set.
* `unit_amount` - (Optional) Int. The per-unit billing amount for each individual unit for which this tier applies.
* `unit_amount_decimal` - (Optional) Float. Same as `unit_amount`, but accepts a decimal value in cents with at most 12
  decimal places. Only one of `unit_amount` and `unit_amount_decimal` can be set.

### Currency Options

`currency_options` Can be used multiple times within the price resource (one block per currency) and supports the 
 following arguments:

* `currency` - (Required) String. Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase - [supported currencies](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies).
* `tax_behavior` - (Optional) String. Only required if a default tax behavior was not provided in the Stripe Tax settings. 
  Specifies whether the price is considered inclusive of taxes or exclusive of taxes. 
  One of `inclusive`, `exclusive`, or `unspecified`. 
  Once specified as either inclusive or exclusive, it cannot be changed.
* `unit_amount` - (Optional) Int. A positive integer in cents (or -1 for a free price) representing how much to charge.
* `unit_amount_decimal` - (Optional) Float. Same as unit_amount, but accepts a decimal value in cents with at most 12
  decimal places. Only one of unit_amount and unit_amount_decimal can be set.
* `custom_unit_amount` - (Optional) List(Resource). When set, 
  provides configuration for the amount to be adjusted by the customer during Checkout Sessions and Payment Links.
  See details in [custom unit amount](#custom-unit-amount).
* `tiers` - (Optional) List(Resource). Each element represents a pricing tier. 
  This parameter requires `billing_scheme` to be set to `tiered`. This resource can be used more than once and follows
  the same fields as the [root tiers block](#tiers)

### Custom Unit Amount

`custom_unit_amount` Only one block is allowed per custom price resource (per currency) with the following arguments:

* `enabled` - (Required) Bool. Pass in `true` to enable `custom_unit_amount`, otherwise omit `custom_unit_amount`.
* `maximum` - (Optional) Int. The maximum unit amount the customer can specify for this item.
* `minimum` - (Optional) Int. The minimum unit amount the customer can specify for this item. 
  Must be at least the minimum charge amount.
* `preset` - (Optional) Int. The starting unit amount which can be updated by the customer.

### Transform Quantity

`transform_quantity` Supports the following arguments:

* `divide_by` - (Required) Int. Divide usage by this number.
* `round` - (Required) String. After division, either round the result `up` or `down`.

## Note on updating prices

Once created, you can update the `active`, `metadata`, `nickname`, `lookup_key`, `tax_behaviour` (only if unspecified)
and `transfer_lookup_key` attributes.

Other attribute edits will trigger a destroy action (archival) and creation of a new price entry.
