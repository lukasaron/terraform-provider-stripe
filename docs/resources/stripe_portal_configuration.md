# stripe_portal_configuration

With this resource, you can create a Customer Portal Configuration - [Stripe API portal configuration documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_portal/configuration).

The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.

A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.

~> Removal of the Customer Portal isn't supported through the Stripe SDK. The best practice, which this provider follows,
is to deactivate the Customer Portal by marking it as inactive on destroy, which indicates that resource is no longer
available.
